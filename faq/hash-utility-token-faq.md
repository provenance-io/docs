## What is the utility of Hash? <a id="what-is-the-utility-of-hash"></a>

Hash has three use cases: as a spam-prevention mechanism, as a staking token, and as a voting mechanism in governance.

As a spam-prevention mechanism, Hash is used to pay fees for validating Provenance Blockchain transactions. Similar to Ethereum’s concept of “gas”, the fee may be proportional to the amount of computation required by the transaction.

As staking tokens, Hash may be “bonded” to earn block rewards. The economic security of the Provenance Blockchain network is a function of the amount of Hash staked. The more Hash that is collateralized, the more “skin” there is at stake and the higher the cost of attacking the network. Thus, the more Hash there are bonded, the greater the economic security of the network.

Hash stakers may govern the Provenance Blockchain Foundation by voting on proposals with their staked Hash.
