# Explorer as a Service

Github repo: [https://github.com/provenance-io/explorer-service](https://github.com/provenance-io/explorer-service)



The service that sits behind the Explorer has 3 objectives:

* to ingest and process blockchain data;
* to aggregate and serve up responsive API queries;
* and to allow for correlation between data points as needed.
