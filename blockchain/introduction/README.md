# Introduction

Provenance Blockchain is a public blockchain network designed and developed to support [financial service industry](../../ecosystem/financial-services-blockchain/) needs by providing a **ledger**, **registry**, and **exchange** across multiple financial assets and markets. 

### Financial Services Use Cases

Provenance Blockchain facilitates the establishment of an ecosystem that garners participation amongst financial functions including asset originators, fund managers, servicers, banks, and investors.

Provenance Blockchain is an eco-friendly, public **proof-of-stake blockchain** that reduces unnecessary computational waste that encumbers proof-of-work blockchains in use today. 

Assets are defined natively using the [Provenance Blockchain Contract Execution Environment](../../p8e/overview/) in conjunction with the [Metadata Module](../../modules/metadata-module.md) enabling organizations to quickly define asset classes, permission data to counter-parties, create mutually agreed-upon processes, define ownership structures, and exchange on third party marketplaces. 

Hash is the Provenance Blockchain utility token to stake, govern, secure, and transact on the network. 

Large financial institutions, investors, technical leaders, and individuals provide the foundation of security and stability of the Provenance Blockchain network by staking Hash as a network [Validator](../../ecosystem/community/validator.md) or [Delegator](../../ecosystem/community/delegator.md) for which they are rewarded with a fee.

While Provenance Blockchain facilitates the establishment of an ecosystem that has garnered participation across all areas of finance including, but not limited to, asset originators, fund managers, servicers, and banks, Provenance Blockchain is openly extensible for developers to build innovative applications that address new use cases. 

Provenance Blockchain is composed of three core concepts:

* **Modules** that implement financial services business logic.  Modules are composed to realize complex financial services processes.
* A **smart contracting engine** to develop and deploy contracts directly to the Provenance Blockchain blockchain.
* **Off-chain client-side agreements** using the Contract Execution Environment.

Each of these core concepts has its own set of strengths allowing complete control of the consumer's private and confidential data.
