# Become a Validator

Validators perform the critical function of proposing and validating transactions on the Provenance Blockchain network. A strong network of validators ensures Provenance Blockchain security is maintained. Validators stake Hash to become part of the active validators on the network and are a foundational element for Hash holders that want to delegate their stake and share in rewards produced by the network's fee distribution framework.

## Quick Start

This quick start assumes that you have already completed the necessary steps to join a full node to the Provenance Blockchain network and are ready to designate the node as a validator.

{% hint style="warning" %}
To configure a validator you need to acquire Hash to grant the newly created validator voting power on the network.
{% endhint %}

### Finding Node Public Key

Each node has a public key that identifies it to other participants on the network. To configure the full node created in [Join Provenance Blockchain Testnet](join-provenance-testnet/), find the public key that identifies the node. Tendermint, the underlying consensus algorithm, provides a simple way to display the key for use.

```
provenanced --testnet tendermint show-validator
```

### Staking Hash to Become a Validator

The following command has a lot of detail that should be closely reviewed.

## Security

Validators are the most important nodes in the network. They require a level of security that ensures they are highly available and protected at every level. The following reviews the recommended network architecture to ensure the Provenance Blockchain network validators are protected. This is patterned after the official [Tendermint Documentation](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/nodes/validators.html).

### Network Architecture

A multi-tier network architecture is recommended to secure validators. Each tier of the network increases restrictions on network access.

#### Tiers

| Tier           | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Public Sentry  | Public Sentry nodes are available to the world and provide a proxy for the network.                                                                           |
| Private Sentry | Private Sentry nodes provide an interconnect layer that can be used to provide more direct integration with large foundational Provenance Blockchain systems. |
| Validator      | The core of the Provenance Blockchain that should be isolated from all public-facing networks.                                                                |
| KMS            | Key Management Service - A remote signing platform that secures access to encryption keys.                                                                    |

![Recommended Network Architecture](<../../../.gitbook/assets/securing-provenanced-validator-2- (2) (2) (1).png>)

The Recommended Network Architecture diagram is the architecture to follow when building out Provenance Blockchain nodes and validators. This may be done in a cloud environment (e.g. AWS, GCP, or Azure), within an on-premise data center, or a combination of both. The idea of this infrastructure will be further detailed below but conceptually it is required to protect the validator by leveraging multiple layers of network security.

### Network Security (Firewall)

The Provenance Blockchain network leverages two different ports (P2P and RPC) by default and should be considered when opening necessary firewall rules.

#### **P2P**

The persistent peer port (P2P) uses TCP port 26656 and is required for nodes to connect to the network and to each other. As such, firewall rules should be created that limit access to this port.

#### **RPC**

The RPC port is the application port that uses TCP port 26657. This port should only be made available to trusted sources. If more public access such as querying the status of the network of specific API endpoints is needed, use NGINX's reverse-proxy to limit that access.

It is recommended that each of these nodes be placed in specific zones or private networks and leverage network firewalls to limit access. For example, the [Public Sentry](configure-a-sentry.md#public-sentry-nodes) nodes should leverage a public IP and access to these nodes will be open to the public. [Private Sentry](configure-a-sentry.md#private-sentry-nodes) nodes should leverage private IPs or whitelist access with public IPs from the public sentry nodes. Validators should always leverage private IP addresses to ensure they are protected.

## Configuration

The validator node requires the highest level of security as it contains the key that will be authorized to sign blocks on the Provenance Blockchain network. If a bad actor gets this key, they could connect to the chain and impersonate that same validator, thereby causing a double signing incident which would result in a validator being jailed and slashed. For this reason, access to this node should be limited to those who absolutely require access. All access should be monitored and recorded via a monitoring solution.

The following configuration parameters are found in the `config.toml` file.

| Configuration          | Setting                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Key Management - HSM

There are multiple solutions available that could be used to provide this network security. One solution readily available is [Tendermint KMS](https://github.com/iqlusioninc/tmkms) which is actively maintained and supports multiple Hardware Security Modules.

The validator consensus key used to sign blocks on the Provenance Blockchain network must be protected. By default, this key is in plain text on the node and anyone with access would be able to obtain it. A remote signer KMS combined with an HSM to ensure the absolute security of the validator key should be leveraged. Due to the strong recommendation of leveraging an HSM, this solution should be built on-site in a Secured Data Center. This would include leveraging network firewalls, secured servers, network switches, and limited access to these devices by necessary personnel.
