# Funding Program

The Foundation is seeded with a generous fund to support the foundation's operation, the core infrastructure, and a grants program for Improvement Projects \(PIPs\). 

Ongoing funding is provided by levying fees \(gas\) on the use of the Provenance blockchain network services. 

The Provenance native utility-token to pay for services is **Hash**, which can be freely bought and sold on publicly exchanges.

## **The** Provenance **Utility-Token: Hash**

Smart-contract and Validator services on the Provenance-blockchain network are paid for in Hash.  2% of that gas fee is levied to support the Provenance foundation.

See the [Hash utility-token section](../../faq/hash-utility-token-faq.md) for details. 

## **The** Provenance **Core Infra Funding**

The core infrastructure services, code and operations have guaranteed funding to ensure a high level of integrity and service-level of the Provenance ecosystem operation.

The foundation works off an annual budget for core infrastructure support, and uses commercial contracts to pay entities for the associated work.

See the [Core Infrastructure Details](core-infrastructure-details.md) page for additional information. ****

## **The** Provenance **Grants Program**

The grants program funds Provenance Improvement Proposals \(PIPs\) that are chosen by the members through voting.

Anyone can propose a project for work that can benefit the community and/or enhance the ecosystem. If the foundation members vote favorably on a proposal, the submitters will be funded for the associated work.

Our Provenance grants program is similar to the [Interchain Foundation funding program](https://interchain.io/funding/) and [Ethereum Foundation's grants](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org/blob/master/subdomains/grants.md) programs.

See the [Grants Program Details](grants-program-details.md) section for additional information.
