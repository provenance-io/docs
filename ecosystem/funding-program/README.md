# Funding Program

The Foundation is seeded with a generous fund to support the foundation's operation, the core infrastructure, and a grants program for Improvement Projects \(PIPs\). 

Ongoing funding is provided by levying fees \(gas\) on the use of the ![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2818%29.png) blockchain network services. 

The ![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2818%29.png) native utility-token to pay for services is **Hash**, which can be freely bought and sold on publicly exchanges.

Smart-contract and Validator services on the ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/AReNslD3Q7Z429WPitxtk0GCeWl3pzfjVkvlFIBttnZhiLNPO9REb8qXveVPsfcvLm3vi71zvRKPuS2dyykZYXVzmJF6GRAuN_hTO0xpTggV-GaZpW9c_R9PLlvAHMA4NR7EezHU)-blockchain network are paid for in Hash.    2% of that gas fee is levied to supports the ![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2818%29.png)foundation.

The core infrastructure services, code and operations have guaranteed funding to ensure a high level of integrity and service-level of the ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/IEinLVkppWJVt_Bq0D6JVBrl5p9x98sXb1q5ieoSsaAoGVswKn0JOvSaOWbDIxtTk0R1yKT3PKUhn9aMX5ASP3-Wx4uRnTAfuk6S2DLT4s7dkpUpt9txlbiDArV4Y5sbfbftMtza)ecosystem operation.

The foundation works off an annual budget for core infrastructure support, and uses commercial contracts to pay entities for the associated work.

Anyone can propose a project for work that can benefit the community and/or enhance the ecosystem. If the foundation members vote favorably on a proposal, the submitters will be funded for the associated work.

Our ![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2818%29.png) grants program is similar to the [Interchain Foundation funding program](https://interchain.io/funding/) and [Ethereum Foundation's grants](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org/blob/master/subdomains/grants.md) programs.
