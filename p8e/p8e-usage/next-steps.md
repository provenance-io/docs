# Next Steps

At this point, you should have a high level background on the Provenance metadata scope module and general concepts of the P8e Contract Execution SDK. From here it would be beneficial to check out the associated Github repositories for further information:

* [p8e-scope-sdk](https://github.com/provenance-io/p8e-scope-sdk)
* [p8e-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/provenance-io/p8e-gradle-plugin)
* [object-store](https://github.com/provenance-io/object-store)

In addition to containing the contract execution interface, the p8e-scope-sdk contains development tools, such as a docker compose environment for local execution, and comprehensive examples that can be used as models for implementation.
