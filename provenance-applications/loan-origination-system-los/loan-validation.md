# Validation

Figure loans undergo a process of validation as part of the onboarding process. The loan validation contracts inspect the data for the loan in the EOS and perform a number of checks to ensure that the Figure underwriting guidelines were met. Any findings are stored in the `validation_results` fact and are available to the Portfolio Manager to display to the originator or interested investors. Execution of validation checks in a client-side contract allows the originator to bypass traditionally manual verification audits.
